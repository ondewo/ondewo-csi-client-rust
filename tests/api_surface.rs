//! The committed stubs match the protos they were generated from.
//!
//! Both sides are DERIVED - the services and rpcs the `ondewo-csi-api` submodule declares, and
//! the routes the generated tonic servers answer - so this needs no update when the API grows,
//! and fails when the stubs were not regenerated after the API pin moved, or when the generator
//! dropped or renamed an rpc. The submodule must be checked out (CI does that).
